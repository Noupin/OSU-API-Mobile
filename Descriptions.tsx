export const UNLIMBTED_PHOENIX_DESCRIPTION = 'This E-Nable hand has a thermoformed gauntlet at the wrist. The Phoenix was designed by Team UnLimbited, and is available on Thingiverse. On Thingiverse, users are able to select a design for the left or right hand. All files necessary for the Phoenix hand will be generated and included in a single .zip file at the correct scale.'
export const PHOENIX_V2_DESCRIPTION = 'The Phoenix V2 is a remix of the original E-Nable Phoenix hand by Jason Bryant, with replacement components by John Diamond, Scott Darrow, and Andreas Bastian.'
export const OSPREY_DESCRIPTION = 'The Osprey hand was built in Blender based on the low-poly interior and robust components of the original Raptor Hand, but now sports an attractive fairing and a very durable and comfortable low-profile universal-fit bracer. It was brought to the maker community by E-Nable and Alderhand.'
export const RAPTOR_RELOADED_DESCRIPTION = 'The same team behind the original Raptor hand released the Raptor Reloaded, a new version of the hand which is updated and re-factored. The main benefit from this re-factored version is that the device was entirely modeled in Fusion 360, a free CAD tool that can import and export most standard body modeling formats such as STEP and IGES. This is done in an effort to lower the barrier to contribution to the E-Nable project for other engineers and designers.'
export const TALON_DESCRIPTION = 'This device is wrist-powered, so it is necessary that the user has a wrist to actuate the fingers. Version 3 of the Talon Hand is easier to build and more comfortable to wear than the previous versions, all the while offering a superior grip.'
export const CYBORG_BEAST_DESCRIPTION = 'The Cyborg Beast hand, like many other designs, need sufficient wrist movement and strength to use properly. The design of this hand includes fingers with higher quality grip, as well as the design doesn\'t require orthoplastic. It fits a 1-2 mm cabling and elastic bands.'
export const ODY_HAND_DESCRIPTION = 'The Ody hand is meant to be a starter hand for children with no fingers, a small palm and some ability to flex or extend the wrist. The idea behind only having three fingers on this device is to fight against the resistance of only three fingers rather than five. The fingers were also made a bit short and blunt to reduce risk injury for children.'
export const FLEXY_HAND_2_DESCRIPTION = 'This is the second iteration of the Flexy-Hand, and is now wearable. This new Flexy-Hand includes extra features including a gauntlet attachment via Filaflex hinges, a sculpted palm socket, adjustable tensioners, discrete internal tendon channels, and it is also a scalable design.'
export const GRIPPER_THUMB_DESCRIPTION = 'The Gripper Thumb TD is an experimental terminal device for upper limb amputees that looks like a passive cosmetic prosthesis, but it performs two-handed tasks without a Bowden cable.. Since the 3D printed device is still experimental, it should not be used without the clinical supervision of a Certified Prosthetist or Occupational Therapist. Special care should be taken in selecting the printing materials to assure that there are no layer adhesion issues or other durability concerns.'
export const PHOENIX_HAND_REBORN_DESCRIPTION = 'The Phoenix Reborn is a remix of the Phoenix Hand and the UnLimbited Arm, designed by Albert Fung. The new aspects of this hand allow an elastic cord to go through tunnels in the hand and in each finger tip. This design also lacks parts in previous Phoenix designs that would not survive heat found in the tropics, making it feasible for more parts of the world.'
